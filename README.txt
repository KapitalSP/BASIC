# 💎 BASIC v10.2: The Tera-Scale Sovereign

> **"Stop Renting Intelligence. Own It."**
> The industrial-grade, zero-latency spinal cord for 1,000B+ parameter AI.

**BASIC** is not a chatbot wrapper. It is a raw, unbuffered pipe between your silicon and the neural weights. We stripped away the safety rails, the bloat, and the cloud dependencies to give you **Absolute Knowledge Sovereignty**.

### ⚡ The Specs (No Compromise)

| Component | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Capacity** | **1,000B+ Ready** (Distributed / Multi-GPU / NUMA-Aware) |
| **Latency** | **0.000s** (Direct Pipe I/O. No Python Buffering.) |
| **Architecture** | **Trust Grid™** (Decoupled Engine & Installer) |
| **Philosophy** | **Zero-Dependency** (Runs offline, forever.) |

---

### 🏛️ The Trust Grid

| Slot | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/models` | **The Brain.** Drop your `.gguf` monoliths here. |
| `/drivers` | **The Muscle.** Auto-managed binaries. Don't touch. |
| `/plugins` | **The Mutation.** Inject Python scripts to extend capabilities. |
| `market.json` | **The Bazaar.** A decentralized registry for tools & models. |

### 🚀 Ignition Sequence

**1. Construct**
Build the infrastructure and summon the core engine.
```bash
python install.py
2. Mount Place your heavy .gguf model in /models. (Warning: For 100B+ models, ensure your VRAM is ready for the weight.)

3. Ignite Sever the connection to the cloud. Start the engine.

Bash
python basic.py
🎮 Console Commands
/market : Access the decentralized extension registry.

/exit : Kill the session.

☠️ Liability & Ethics
We provide the engine. You steer the car.

Zero Liability: The architect is not responsible for what you build or destroy with this tool.

The Code: Do not cross the line. With great power comes the absolute responsibility to wield it wisely.
