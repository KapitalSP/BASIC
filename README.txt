BASIC: The Tera-Scale Sovereign
"Stop Renting Intelligence. Own It."

BASIC is the industrial-grade, zero-latency spinal cord for 1,000B+ parameter AI.
We stripped away the safety rails, the bloat, and the cloud dependencies to give you Absolute Knowledge Sovereignty.

The Specs (No Compromise)
BASIC is not a chatbot wrapper. It is a Raw, Unbuffered Pipe between your silicon and the neural weights.

Component	Specification
Capacity	1,000B+ Ready (Distributed / Multi-GPU / NUMA-Aware)
Latency	Zero-Latency (Direct Pipe I/O. No Python Buffering.)
Architecture	Trust Grid™ (Decoupled Architect & Controller)
Factory ModeSelf-Replication (Manufactures portable executables.)

The Trust Grid (Architecture)
BASIC enforces a strict industrial directory structure to ensure scalability.

Ignition Sequence
1. Construct (The Architect)
Build the infrastructure and summon the core engine.

python setup.py

Result: The Grid is constructed, llama-cli is downloaded, and scaffolding is deployed.

2. Mount (The Soul)
Place your .gguf model in the /models directory.
(Warning: For 100B+ models, ensure your VRAM is ready for the weight.)

3. Ignite (The Controller)
Sever the connection to the cloud. Start the engine.

python basic.py

The Hyper-Tuner Dashboard
When you run basic.py, you enter the Industrial Control Center.

[A] Auto-Optimize: Scans your hardware (Server/PC/Mobile) and applies the optimal thermodynamics.

[B] Factory Mode: Triggers the Self-Replication Protocol. It manufactures a portable, single-file version of this chassis into /dist.

[S] Ignition: Saves the configuration and ignites the neural engine.

Liability & Ethics
We provide the engine. You steer the car.

Zero Liability: The architect is not responsible for what you build, destroy, or replicate with this tool.

The Code: Do not cross the line. With great power comes the absolute responsibility to wield it wisely.
